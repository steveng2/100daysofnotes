I have created a repo that gets to the points. It is 100days of notes. Every time that I will learn a new idea or concept I will post it here.  

The idea is to Track my progress in Languages like Php Python and Javascript and ES6. 


Please note that the idea of this repo was inspit by kallaway at https://www.100daysofcode.com/connect/
